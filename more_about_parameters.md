# The parameters needed to run Alpha Fold are:

ALPHAFOLD_DATA_PATH: Absolute path to folder with databases.

ALPHAFOLD_MODELS: Absolute path to folder with models.

pwd: Path to Singularity Image File (SIF) file.

fasta_paths: Path to the input sequence in fasta format.

uniref90_database_path: Path to Uniref90 database for use by JackHMMER.

mgnify_database_path: Path to the MGnify database for use by JackHMMER.

bfd_database_path: Path to the BFD database for use by HHblits.

uniclust30_database_path: Path to Uniclust30 database for use by HHblits.

pdb70_database_path: Path to PDB70 database for use by HHsearch.

template_mmcif_dir_ Path to a directory with template mmCIF structures, each named <pdb_id>.cif.

uniprot_database_path Path to the UniProt database for AlphaFold Multimer.

obsolete_pdbs_path: Path to a file mapping obsolete PDB IDs to their replacements.

max_template_date: Maximum template release date to consider (ISO-8601 format - i.e. YYYY-MM-DD). Important if folding historical test sets. Default is None.

output_dir: Path to a directory that will store the results.

model_preset: [‘monomer’, ‘monomer_casp14’, ‘monomer_ptm’, ‘multimer’]. Control which AlphaFold model use, choosing between the original model used at CASP14 with no ensembling (monomer), the original model used at CASP14 with num_ensemble=8, matching our CASP14 configuration (monomer_casp14), the original CASP14 model fine tuned with the pTM head, providing a pairwise confidence measure (‘monomer_ptm’) and the AlphaFold-Multimer model (‘multimer’), to use this model, provide a multi-sequence FASTA file.

db_preset: [‘reduced_dbs’, ‘full_dbs’, ‘casp14’]. Choose preset model configuration - no ensembling and smaller genetic database config (reduced_dbs), no ensembling and full genetic database config (full_dbs) or full genetic database config and 8 model ensemblings (casp14). Default is full_dbs.

benchmark: [True, False]. Run multiple JAX model evaluations to obtain a timing that excludes the compilation time, which should be more indicative of the time required for inferencing many proteins. Default is False.



# AlphaFold output
The outputs will be in a subfolder of output_dir. They include the computed MSAs, unrelaxed structures, relaxed structures, ranked structures, raw model outputs, prediction metadata, and section timings. The output_dir directory will have the following structure:

<target_name>/
    |- input/
       |- features.pkl
       |- ranked_{0,1,2,3,4}.pdb
       |- ranking_debug.json
       |- relaxed_model_{1,2,3,4,5}.pdb
       |- result_model_{1,2,3,4,5}.pkl
       |- timings.json
       |- unrelaxed_model_{1,2,3,4,5}.pdb
       |- msas/
          |- bfd_uniclust_hits.a3m
          |- mgnify_hits.sto
          |- uniref90_hits.sto
The contents of each output file are as follows:

features.pkl: A pickle file containing the input feature NumPy arrays used by the models to produce the structures.

unrelaxed_model_x.pdb: A PDB format text file containing the predicted structure, exactly as outputted by the model.

relaxed_model_x.pdb: A PDB format text file containing the predicted structure, after performing an Amber relaxation procedure on the unrelaxed structure prediction (see Jumper et al. 2021, Suppl. Methods 1.8.6 for details).

ranked_x.pdb: A PDB format text file containing the relaxed predicted structures, after reordering by model confidence. Here ranked_0.pdb should contain the prediction with the highest confidence, and ranked_4.pdb the prediction with the lowest confidence. To rank model confidence, we use predicted LDDT (pLDDT) scores (see Jumper et al. 2021, Suppl. Methods 1.9.6 for details).

ranking_debug.json: A JSON format text file containing the pLDDT values used to perform the model ranking, and a mapping back to the original model names.

timings.json: A JSON format text file containing the times taken to run each section of the AlphaFold pipeline.

msas/: - A directory containing the files describing the various genetic tool hits that were used to construct the input MSA.

result_model_x.pkl: A pickle file containing a nested dictionary of the various NumPy arrays directly produced by the model. In addition to the output of the structure module, this includes auxiliary outputs such as:

Distograms (distogram/logits contains a NumPy array of shape [N_res, N_res, N_bins] and distogram/bin_edges contains the definition of the bins).

Per-residue pLDDT scores (plddt contains a NumPy array of shape [N_res] with the range of possible values from 0 to 100, where 100 means most confident). This can serve to identify sequence regions predicted with high confidence or as an overall per-target confidence score when averaged across residues.

Present only if using pTM models: predicted TM-score (ptm field contains a scalar). As a predictor of a global superposition metric, this score is designed to also assess whether the model is confident in the overall domain packing.

Present only if using pTM models: predicted pairwise aligned errors (predicted_aligned_error contains a NumPy array of shape [N_res, N_res] with the range of possible values from 0 to max_predicted_aligned_error, where 0 means most confident). This can serve for a visualisation of domain packing confidence within the structure.
